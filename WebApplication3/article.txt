The revelation also marks the second major challenge for the White House this week, coming just a day after a report in The Washington Post that the president disclosed highly classified information to Russian diplomats during a private meeting last week at the White House. And it comes at a particularly precarious time for the Trump administration as it searches for someone to nominate to succeed Comey as the next leader of the FBI — the official who will take over investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election and any coordination between Trump associates and Russian officials.

President Trump asked the FBI to drop its probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynn and urged former FBI director James B. Comey instead to pursue reporters in leak cases, according to associates of Comey who have seen private notes he wrote recounting the conversation.


“I hope you can let this go,’’ Trump said, according to the Comey notes, which were described by the associates. Comey’s written account of the meeting is two pages long and highly detailed, the associates said.


Current and former officials have described ongoing tensions between the Trump administration and the FBI over the issue of the Russia probe and leaks. The president and others have repeatedly pressed the FBI to focus more of its energy on pursuing leakers than on the Russia investigation, these officials said. While the FBI is investigating disclosures of classified information, other issues that Trump and the administration wanted to be investigated did not involve classified information, and FBI officials have resisted demands that they pursue such issues.

At the time of the Trump-Comey conversation in February, Flynn had just been forced to resign after it was revealed public statements made by Vice President Pence and others on his behalf were not true. In those statements, White House officials had denied that Flynn had discussed easing U.S. sanctions against Russia when he spoke to Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in late December. U.S. intelligence intercepts showed that they had discussed the topic, according to people familiar with the matter.


According to the director’s notes, Comey did not respond directly to the president’s entreaties, only agreeing with Trump’s assertion that Flynn “is a good guy.’’ The notes also described how the president said that he wanted to see reporters in jail for leaks and expressed his dissatisfaction with what he viewed as the FBI’s inaction in pursuing whoever leaked his conversations with foreign leaders, according to Comey associates.

According to the notes written by Comey following a February meeting with the president, Trump brought up the counterintelligence investigation into Flynn and urged Comey to drop the probe in the wake of the national security adviser’s resignation.

“There’s definitely a case to be made for obstruction,” said Barak Cohen, a former federal prosecutor who now does white-collar-defense work at the Perkins Coie law firm in the District. “But, on the other hand, you have to realize that — as with any other sort of criminal law — intent is key, and intent here can be difficult to prove.”

Comey’s account of the February talk made it clear that his understanding of the conversation was that the president was seeking to impede the investigation, according to people who have read the account or had it read to them. Comey’s notes also made it clear he felt that the conversation with the president was improper and decided to withhold details of it from the case agents working on the Russia probe, according to the associates.


From the question and answer, it is unclear if McCabe was speaking only about Comey’s firing not interfering with the Russia investigations, or whether he was saying that there was no effort to impede in any Trump-related matter.


Instead, the president said, he was thinking of the Russia probe when he decided to fire the FBI director. He also suggested that there might be recordings of his conversations with Comey. Since then, White House officials have steadfastly refused to say whether the president’s conversations have been recorded.

Some Republicans put the burden on Mr. Comey to produce proof, with Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah, the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, vowing to obtain a memo Mr. Comey wrote in which he said Mr. Trump had made his request on the Flynn investigation during a meeting in February.

Democrats were aggressive in seeking new hearings and an independent investigation. Republicans, on the whole, reserved judgment until they learned more or heard from Mr. Comey himself.


The news of Mr. Comey’s memo, a day after it was disclosed that Mr. Trump had revealed sensitive intelligence to Russian officials, added another layer of chaos and uncertainty on Capitol Hill, diverting attention from debates on health care and tax policy and increasing many lawmakers’ reservations about the president.


Other Republicans said they had not had time to process the news of Mr. Comey’s memo. “I don’t know the facts,” said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the second most powerful Senate Republican, who took himself out of contention on Tuesday to be Mr. Comey’s replacement.


By evening, the drama swelled with the news of Mr. Comey’s memo, and Democrats demanded an even more aggressive investigation of Mr. Trump.

“If true, this is yet another disturbing allegation that the president may have engaged in some interference or obstruction of the investigation,’’ said Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. He said Comey “should come back to the Congress and share with us what he knows in terms of the president’s conversations with him on any of the Russian investigations.’’

Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said the report solidified the need for Mr. Comey to brief lawmakers again. He said they also wanted to see his notes.


Throughout his long career in law enforcement, Comey has been known to write down what transpired in important meetings and conversations, particularly ones in which he felt there were potentially tricky legal or ethical issues.

Last week, as he sought to explain his rationale for firing Comey, the president also sparked another controversy by contradicting his own aides’ claims that Comey had been fired over his handling of the investigation into former secretary of state Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server.

Lawmakers in both parties were largely confounded by the latest controversy, one in a series of self-made crises that have hobbled their ability to move forward with Mr. Trump’s policy priorities.


Later, when asked during a news conference on Capitol Hill whether he was concerned about Mr. Trump’s competence in handling intelligence information, Mr. McConnell paused for several beats before responding, “No.”


Asked if he was any more inclined now to embrace a special prosecutor to investigate ties between Mr. Trump’s associates and Russia, Mr. Graham said no. “Nobody’s showing me a crime anywhere,” he said.


Some Republicans seemed inclined to defend Mr. Trump and to question any news report that suggested executive impropriety. After a lengthy defense of the president, Senator Jim Risch of Idaho turned to an Associated Press reporter who appeared unconvinced.
